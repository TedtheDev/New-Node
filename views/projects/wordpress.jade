        | After my first website, I felt it was from the 1990s. I looked into Wordpress as my first web content management system to get a modern look for the upcoming career fair for school.
        | Here is the second iteration of my website, <a href="http://tyleredmunds.co.nf">tyleredmunds.co.nf</a>.

        | I picked out a new theme that looked good for potential people that would look at my site. I added some plugins, learned how Wordpress worked, and included some HTML.
        | I included a couple blog posts to update people about my expreience since creating it. I learned about setting up the MySQL database for Wordpress in order for it to function.

        | After setting everything up, the website looked good. It was mobile responsive and worked well on desktop screens too. I was proud of my work again.
