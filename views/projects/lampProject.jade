        | At my first internship at Caterpillar, my project was to create a web application for my team. The As-Is system used an excel document so you would search this excel docuemnt to lookup server information.
        | My goal was to create an application so the team can search any server attribute, such as IP Address, Hostname, OS, etc and the application would send a list where you could click on a server and see all the information so the team can do their job more efficient and faster

        | This is when I learned that I will be using the LAMP stack. I learned PHP by using w3schools again. It was very quick to catch on how to use PHP, because I had my school experience using Java.
